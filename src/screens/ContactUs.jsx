                                    <h4>Q: How does Prehome work?</h4>
                                    <p>A: Prehome enables you to move into your dream home today as a renter and through a financially beneficial rental plan over the tenure make you a fully-eligible homeowner. The prehome program offers the benefit of locking in the property's value on day 1, allowing the benefits of capital appreciation to flow to you when you are ready to buy the house after the tenure.</p>
                                    <h4>Q: How does the rent-to-own program work?</h4>
                                    <p>A: PreHome's rent-to-own program allows customers to rent a ready-to-move-in apartment with the option to purchase it after the rental period is over. During the rental period, customers can build up their savings in order to have the ability to buy the home when they are ready at the end of the tenure.</p>
                                    <h4>Q: What is the minimum and maximum rental period for Prehome's rental program?</h4>
                                    <p>A: The rental period may vary based on the property and location, but typically, Prehome offers a minimum rental period of 2 years and a maximum rental period of 3 years.</p>
                                    <h4>Q: What is the process for purchasing the apartment after the rental period is over?</h4>
                                    <p>A: At the end of the rental period, customers have the option to purchase the apartment at a locked-in price, which is specified right at the time of renting the apartment.</p>
                                    <h4>Q: What if I am unable to continue with the Prehome program?</h4>
                                    <p>A:    The Prehome program is designed to offer you flexibility to decide on your commitment to home ownership. The program has two phases, a rental phase and the phase that provides the person with the option to choose to unlock ownership after a fixed tenure. You have the option to opt out in case you are unable to continue with the program.</p>
                                    <h4>Q. Is the Prehome program like a loan?</h4>
                                    <p>A: No, loan providing institutions (usually banks and NBFCs) allow you to borrow money to purchase a home. These institutions require you to pay a down payment and over time you pay back the institutions along with floating rate interests that these institutions keep changing over time.
                                        With Prehome, you are not taking a loan, but choosing a new path to home ownership. Our investors/partners own the home while allowing you to graduate from being a renter to a homeowner. There's no debt to repay or interest charged as you haven't borrowed anything from them.</p>
                                        <h4>Q. What if Prehome goes out of business?</h4>
                                        <p>A: The Prehome program is designed to protect the home and your path to home ownership irrespective of the least possible outcomes. The agreements you sign are designed to protect you from such outcomes.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Q. Is the Prehome model different from renting?</h4>
                                        <p>A: Principally, Prehome isn’t much different from renting in practice. However, a lot of features of the program are designed specifically to enable you to be a homeowner. 
                                            Unlike renting, you cannot be asked to leave at any point of time as long as you're paying rent and not breaching the contract.<br/>Additionally with Prehome, you get the following benefits over traditional rentals.</p>
