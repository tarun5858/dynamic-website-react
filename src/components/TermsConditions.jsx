                <h3>ABOUT US</h3>

                <p>
                  At Prehome, our journey began with a deep-seated conviction
                  that the dream of owning a home should be more than just a
                  distant aspiration for first-time homebuyers. Witnessing the
                  trials and tribulations of these individuals, we embarked on a
                  mission to reimagine this journey and make it not only
                  achievable but transformative.
                </p>
